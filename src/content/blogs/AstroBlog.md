tldr: Finally built a dev blog! Comitting to something other than React was probably the hardest part. Glad I chose Astro and stuck with it.

## Lots of Great Content 3
was just thinking about all this great content. Can't belive I built this blog with Astro!
### More great content
doing this shit was kind hard. I really didn't think it would be this hard and the website still looks like shit compared to some of the others that I've seen. 
## Some More Decent Content
```js
let a = 1;
const b = a * 2
```
