## My Lore

Since its my first blog post I feel like I need to explain some of my lore. I'm historically a poor writer so this site is an attempt to improve and document things I'm working on or just find interesting. 

### Dec 2019 - Jan 2020
Graduating from UNC Charlotte as a Business major (with no interships or clout) in December 2019. I really had no idea what I wanted to do. 

I was working as a line cook in a local resturant and I thought I would just do that for the rest of my life (no drug tests, yay) and maybe go to a cheap culinary program down the street from where I lived in North Carolina. I had huge dreamsna and aspirations /s.  

Upon graduating a buddy of mine had told me that I should just do a coding bootcamp at UNC Charlotte because I could turn that into a decent paying job. They knew I had an interest in computers already since we both attended a local magnet school but we had been in different computer based tracks. 

My track had been "Computer Hardware" where we were supposed to learn the basics of Networking and Hardware and we all graduated with some CompTia certs. 

Truly all we ever did as a was build a computer from scratch and then spend every waking minute trying to figure out how to bypass the school firewall in order to start Minecraft servers, play Call of Duty 1, and watch movies on our school allocated Chromebooks.

I took the money I saved for the culinary school and enrolled in the bootcamp total cost of ~10k. I figured by the time it was over I would get a full time job as a software developer and recoup the money.

### Jan 2020 - Mid Apr 2020

The bootcamp started and I was struggling. I never really worked hard at anything other than trying to be good at soccer. Looking back I had two main issues:

1. Afraid to fail
2. I didn't know how to think deeply

Software Development is all about working from a state of failure. I was taking all these bugs or compiler errors as me being a poor programmer. If things didn't come naturally to me I would shy away from it. I wouldn't even really try or struggle since I was afarid of failing. 

Towards the end when little sparks were flying and I was starting to get things to click I couldn't think deeply enough to string more than a couple thoughts together on harder problems. Solutions that weren't right in my face seemed impossible to me and I couldn't google to save my life. I finished the bootcamp feeling deflated and with COVID in full swing things were looking very dire for me.

### Mid Apr 2020 - May 2020

There was about two weeks post graduation of the bootcamp was probably the lowest in my career and it hadn't even started yet lol. I took this time to really reflect on what I wanted to do and what I needed to do to get there. Within that two week period I came to one realization that really saved me and jump started my career.

Since graduation I was comparing myself to people with Comp Sci degress, other people who graduated from previous bootcamps, tech influencers, and kids who had been programming since they were 12 years old getting discouraged everytime I looked at Twitter and Reddit until one day it really just hit me that 

**Every developer is self taught**

The more time I spent comparing myself to others or regretting my 4 year degree was time wasted from improving myself and making myself more marketable as a developer. During the bootcamp I expected someone else to teach me how to think and program but thats a horrible way to learn. Struggling by myself in my parents house is where I made the greatest sides and where a lot of topics that were introduced to me via the bootcamp clicked. 

### May 2020 - Aug 2020

This period is where I solidified lots of topics that I was introduced to prior. Promises, higher order and first class functions, TypeScript typings, React Hooks, how to focus, and most importantly, how to google and read documentation to figure things out on my own. I was also building crappy little one off projects in Python. I built a finance calculator as a desktop app that calculated commone finance items like; compound interest, Bond equivalent yield, Sharpes ratio and called it PyFi. My girlfriend also needed a custom way to store her makeup inventory to keep track of what she had so I built the shittest Front end from 1990 and a Django backend with Postgresql for her completely on my own. I started to build confidence that I could learn on the fly and make things happen. In July of 2020 I started to apply for as many internships and low level jobs that I could find online. 

### Aug 2020 - Feb 2021

I'll admit that I got really luck but after a 30+ applications and some networking through my girlfriends parents I landed a QA position at a startup out of Miami. I interned for a month at 600 bucks a week helping a team doing manual testing until September and then they made me full time under the assumption I would automate the manual tests that I was doing. Using Java + Selenium I built a suite test around their main flows the main piece was their credit card flow so I automated using all the different Stripe test cards. I was also the lead QA on a ticketing system and I created an automated test suite around that. Being my first job I was honestly pretty timid. I didn't stand up to anyone and the developers kinda walked all over me as they pushed their features out and some stuff was just blatently wrong and not working because I was avoiding confrontation with them. 

October I moved in with my girlfriend and best friend in a house that we split rent 3 ways so $433 a month. 

I learned a lot but being a QA and automation wasn't really for me. I ended up leaving in February to work at Spectrum and attempt to go back to school @ NC State because I thought getting a masters degree in Computer Science would help me stand out in a pool of applicants. 

### Feb 2021 - Mar 2021

Spectrum didn't work out. I'm afraid of heights and in order to repair internet connections and hops at peoples houses we needed to get up on a HUGE ladder. For our first training session I froze and also dropped the ladder on myself and the next day I returned all the shit. Including the work van, boots, all the supplies we were given because I knew it wasn't for me. I was jobless again and didn't know what to do. 

### Mar 2021 - Sept 2021

This period was a GRIND. I got a job working at Geek Squad at my local Best Buy and was also doing Instacart for like two weeks. I was taking classes @ NC State trying to get into their Masters program in the meantime. Working part time and going back to school over the summer was good practice in time management. It helped me get into a grove of continously learning and to become disciplined in my learning instead of relying upon motivation. During this time I wasn't really apply to any FT software developer jobs because I didn't see anything that I thought I could get into.

I was looking for organizations that would take people and pay to train them and then help them get placed at a job as a contractor with hopes of FT employemnt if I performaned well enough. I found an organization called SkillStorm that operated out of Jacksonville Florida and applied there received a call from a recruiter and set up a technical interview with one of their trainers for late August. I grinded Data Structures and Algorithms for about 2 months as first semester of classes was finishing up and sat for the interview and crushed it. They told me I made it into their training program and after Labor Day the class would begin to train and that I should ideally be placed in December of that year.

It dawned on me that I was doing another bootcamp except this time I was actually getting paid for it instead of the other way around. The organization didn't require Computer Science or STEM degress but I was one of the few people who didn't have one and I was determined to work hard in order to stand out and get placed at a decent client.
